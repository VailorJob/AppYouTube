# AppYouTube
 
After you download this repository, you can run first_run.bat (if you don't want open console) for install all libraries.
The subscribe.txt file is needed for the YouTube channels you want to subscribe to (the channel link must be entered on a new line).
youtube.bat launches the application. 
After launch, channels are added to the library, which are located in the subscribe.txt file.

In the application, you can add new channels in the ***Channels*** tab, in the ***My videos*** tab, you can search for videos from added channels by video name and in the ***Search*** tab, search for videos on youtube.
